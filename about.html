        <h1>Nice to meet you.</h1>
        <p>My name is Jess Guilford. I started building websites as a kid, but it took me a few years (and a business degree) to realize that yes, <em>this</em> is what I want to do. I currently study at Epicodus and spend my nights building my own projects. I like to think it's the good kind of obsession.</p>
        <!-- <p>I love making things more beautiful, more functional, and more original. I believe that quality is everything, and that beauty makes our lives a little better. To me, that means putting usability first, creating gorgeous designs, and never taking shortcuts.</p> -->
        <br />
        <h1>Some cool things I've done</h1>
        <h2>(AKA My Resume)</h2>
        <p><strong>Managed e-commerce marketing for a vintage furniture store:</strong> At City Home, I established a style guide and social media strategy (and more doubled their instagram following + engagement in two months). I currently manage their email marketing and blog.</p>
