        <h1>Nice to meet you.</h1>
        <p>My name is Jess Guilford. I started building websites as a kid, but it took me a few years (and a business degree) to realize that yes, <em>this</em> is what I want to do. I currently study at Epicodus and spend my nights building my own projects. I like to think it's the good kind of obsession.</p>
        <br />
        <h2>What I do when I'm not coding</h2>
        <p>I love spending time with friends, cooking, and catching the occasional concert. On weekends, I like to go down to my favorite eastside bar and draw (you can even see my drawings on some of my web projects).
        <!-- <p>I love making things more beautiful, more functional, and more original. I believe that quality is everything, and that beauty makes our lives a little better. To me, that means putting usability first, creating gorgeous designs, and never taking shortcuts.</p> -->
