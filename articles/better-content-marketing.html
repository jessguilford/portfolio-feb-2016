        <h1>Want to get better at content marketing?<br />Stop reading articles about content marketing</h1>
        <h2>Less jargon, more substance.</h2>
        <p>Have you read an article about content marketing in the last 5 years? I can summarize it for you:</p>

        <p>"Provide good content"</p>

        <p>Aha! But how?</p>

        <p>"Provide good content...by creating high quality content"</p>

        <p>Well, that's certainly not wrong, but it is tautological. Personally, I'm not into reading articles that all shill the same boring, vague advice. I bet you're not either.</p>

        <p>So, how do we learn to actually create better content? By studying the building blocks of writing, design, and problem-solving. Here are 8 books and websites that have helped me tell better stories, provide more useful information, and make it all look fantastic.</p>
